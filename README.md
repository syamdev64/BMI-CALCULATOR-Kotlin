# BMI-CALCULATOR-Kotlin
The BMI Calculator is a simple Kotlin application designed to help users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. This project serves as an introductory exercise in Kotlin programming, showcasing fundamental concepts such as user input, basic arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.

Features
-------------
   
    User Input: Prompts the user to enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
    BMI Calculation: Computes the BMI using the formula:
    BMI=(height2)weightâ€‹
    BMI Classification: Provides feedback on the user's BMI category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity) based on the calculated value.
    MVVM Architecture: Implements the MVVM pattern to separate the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model), enhancing code organization and testability.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple console-based interface for easy interaction.


Technologies Used
-------------------
    Kotlin: The primary programming language used for development.
    IntelliJ IDEA: The IDE used for writing and testing the Kotlin code.
    MVVM Architecture: For better separation of concerns and maintainability.
